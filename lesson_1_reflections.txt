BREAKING: Dean Ayer cast as Batman
After his surprise appearance in 'Man of Steel', 
Warner Bros. has officially confirmed that
Academy-Award winner Dean Ayer (Saving Private Ryan, 
Star Wars: The Force Awakens) has been cast as 
Bruce Wayne/Batman in the upcoming 'Batman' reboot, 
tentatively scheduled for release in May 2019. 

No other casting details have been announced about the 
'Batman' reboot. Earlier rumors had suggested that 
Academy-Award winner Max Landis (Saving Private Ryan, 
The Imitation Game) would be penning the new take on the 
iconic hero, but the studio provided no confirmation today. 

UPDATE:
Speculation is running rampant that Academy-Award
winner Felicity Jones (Theory of Everything, Rogue One)
has joined the cast of the 'Batman' reboot in an 
unspecified role. Ayer and Jones famously appeared 
together in 'Theory of Everything' and have been
romantically linked since 2013.  

UPDATE 2:
Felicity Jones is not being considered for a role
in the 'Batman' reboot, her rep confirms. Numerous 
directors are being eyed for the film, including Ben
Affleck, David Fincher, Patty Jenkins, and even Ayer, 
himself. 

UPDATE 3:
Sources say that the 'Batman' reboot may in fact be
an adaptation of the legendary 'Mask of the Phantasm'
story arc. Ayer and Warner Bros. had no comment.
